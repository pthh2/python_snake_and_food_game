# python_snake_and_food_game
This is a game project. A snake can move to eat food.
Its body will lengthen. Every time it eats food, it will be scored on the board.
The player controls this snake with the computer keyboard (arrows: up, down, left , right). They will lose if the snake hits the walls from 4 directions or hits its tail.
